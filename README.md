# 99 Lattes
Solutions of the famous "Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems" but in Coffeescript, hence "99 Lattes", get it?

A whole latte Coffeescript! Assuming I finish this, of course. If only there were some caffeinated beverage that could fuel me through this endeavor. I'll have to ponder on that one, hmmm... Seriously though, others contributions are welcome, in fact encouraged. (I'm new to github, is that already assumed? Anyway...)

A repo like this wouldn't be complete without the obligatory "I got 99 problems but a [bad pun goes here]" Jay-Z reference, for example, "I got 99 Coffeescripts but a decaf ain't one!" If you can come up with something even funnier (which seems likely), just send a pull request and I'll add it to the README.
